This program requires a user to enter date with YYYY-MM-DD format. After entering the date, bot will start scraping the top 100 song titles on that date from Billboard Hot 100 website into a Python list. Using Spotipy library and Spotify API, it will search for the songs in the list and group all songs in a Playlist.
